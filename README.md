When crafting programs for maintainability and readability, Itâ€™s important to use a modular and object-oriented approach. By breaking down code into manageable bits and sufficiently commenting on the code, it opens the code up to other developers who may need to access it in the future. The CRUD Python module saved a lot of time and code, by not having to add the code to connect the database in the Dash app itself, as well as providing the methods to create, read, update, and delete entries by calling the module rather than typing the functions every time. It can also be repurposed into other applications that need to access mongoDB.
Approaching a problem as a computer scientist involves systematic problem-solving. For the Grazioso Salvare project, it was important to understand the database and dashboard requirements. The dashboard requirements were met by using the Dash framework, using components such as DataTables and interactive graphs. This differs from my previous assignments due to needing to integrate the database with a web application.
Computer scientists play a crucial role in helping companies. It lets them see and analyze animal rescue data which aids in decision-making and visualization of current trends, with minimal effort, which in turn increases productivity.
